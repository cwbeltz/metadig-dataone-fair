### Software

These analyses were performed in R (4.0.2) on the Aurora server operated by NCEAS at the University of California Santa Barbara.



## Acknowledgments

Work on these analyses and dashboard was supported by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) and the Arctic Data Center (ADC), as part of my Data Science Fellowship. NCEAS is a Center funded by the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the State of California. The ADC is the primary data and software repository for the Arctic section of National Science Foundationâ€™s Office of Polar Programs.
